## Description

This project will compare methods for handling missing data in variant annotations for the purpose of building variant pathogenicity metapredictors.

See [the research plan](docs/research_plan/research_plan.md) for a more detailed description. 

To generate a PDF version with a working references section:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/blueprint-genetics/amiss.git
$ cd amiss/docs/research_plan
$ make
```

[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) and a [LaTeX distribution](https://www.latex-project.org/) must be installed.

## Open science

  - The source code is freely available under the [MIT license](https://github.com/blueprint-genetics/amiss/blob/master/LICENSE) at [GitHub](https://github.com/blueprint-genetics/amiss)
- Open notebook:
  - You can follow development from the start on GitHub at https://github.com/blueprint-genetics/amiss
  - The research plan is available [in the GitHub repository](https://github.com/blueprint-genetics/amiss/blob/master/docs/research_plan/research_plan.md) (see [section above][Description] for producing a PDF version)
- Open access:
  - We will upload a preprint of the resulting paper(s) on [biorXiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/)
  - We will submit the results for publication in a peer-reviewed open access journal
- Open communication:
  - We intend to present the results in public scientific conferences
- Open collaboration:
  - We welcome
